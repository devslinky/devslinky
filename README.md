Yeo! Hows it going, my name is Devraj. I am a programmer studying Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. I have dabbled in a few small projects using a Java and C to, you know, "cosolidate my understanding of coding fundementals". However, moving forward, I wish to persue larger projects and explore new techologies in the current markets. Currently, I am interested in learning more about optimization algorithms and machine learning. If you are even reading this, and for some reason you wish to connect with me, feel free to reach out to me through my socials @www.linkedin.com/in/devrajsolanki, or my ig handle @devslinky or even through my emails @devslinky@gmail.com or (if you want a professional email) @devraj.solanki@mail.utoronto.ca. Aight ciao.
